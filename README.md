# Time-Series-Forecasting-

Energy experts use, data-driven techniques especially sequential models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict future electricity prices. However, they face challenges with gradient vanishing or exploding when processing lengthy sequential data. So its new version, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks addresses this issue by selectively preserving or discarding information over extended periods. The next latest model, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a simpler variation that combines gates, reducing complexity and enhancing learning efficiency. LSTM excels in capturing long-term relationships, while GRU is simpler and faster learning.

We implement these techniques for day-ahead electricity forecasting using the UK dataset. The ENTSO-E Transparency Platform is used to acquire authentic, high-quality data from the UK's electricity market, which captures granular details from energy transmission systems and market platforms. The above-mentioned DL techniques were implemented using Python and TensorFlow with some other important libraries in the Colab environment.

We observed (from the results as attached) that, while RNN, LSTM, and GRU offer powerful tools for time series analysis, implementation crucial results. The GRU model's exceptional performance demonstrates its efficiency in capturing complex patterns within the UK electricity dataset. Its updated architecture and fewer parameters enable faster training and computational efficiency, allowing it to better navigate the complexities of long-term sequential dependencies in electricity price data.
